/**
 * Outcome of one business-record write, and the exact payload the idempotency ledger stores for it.
 *
 * A mutation has to be describable twice: once to the caller that performed it, and again to a caller
 * that repeats the same command under the same idempotency key and must be told what already happened
 * rather than having it happen again. This value object is both. `toArray()` is what the ledger persists
 * and checksums and `fromArray()` is how a replay rebuilds it, with `replayed` telling the two apart on
 * the way out. Every field is re-validated in the constructor, so a ledger row that was truncated or
 * tampered with fails to rebuild instead of being handed on as a plausible result.
