/**
 * One instance of a business definition, as the domain holds it between a read and a write.
 *
 * This is the currency of the whole BusinessRecord slice: repositories decode rows into it, the service
 * layer validates and hands it to policy, and every write returns a fresh instance rather than mutating
 * one. Two things make that safe. Construction re-checks the identity, version, workflow, actor and
 * lifecycle invariants on every instance, including the ones a repository builds from storage, so a row
 * that drifted cannot enter the domain. And each lifecycle transition is a named method that produces a
 * successor with `version` already incremented, which is the value the repository presents as the
 * optimistic lock, so no caller has to remember to bump it.
 *
 * The record knows the definition version it was written under and carries it forward unchanged. A
 * record read under an older shape stays on that shape until something migrates it, rather than being
 * silently reinterpreted against the newest definition.
