/**
 * How long a command's idempotency claim replays, and how long it is remembered after that.
 *
 * The caller mints the operation identifier, so the platform's half of the bargain is saying for how long
 * that identifier means something. Two horizons say it, and they are deliberately different:
 *
 * - **The replay horizon.** Inside it a repeat of the command hands back the outcome the first attempt
 *   recorded, so the command has exactly one effect however many times it is submitted.
 * - **The retention horizon.** Between the replay horizon and this one the claim is still in the ledger
 *   but no longer replays, so a late arrival is *refused by name* rather than silently becoming a second
 *   effect. Refusal is the whole point: a duplicate that is announced can be reconciled, and one that is
 *   not becomes a second document nobody knows about.
 *
 * A terminal that captured work offline and reconnects days later is the case this exists for. Decision
 * D14 does not build point of sale, but it does require that a long disconnection is a configuration
 * question rather than an architectural impossibility — so the window is declared, bounded and
 * configurable rather than a fixed day compiled into a mutation path.
 *
 * The retention horizon is the instant a claim becomes collectable, which is what the ledger stores as
 * the entry's expiry; the replay horizon is derived from the instant the claim was taken and is never
 * stored, so widening or narrowing the replay window changes how existing claims behave without
 * rewriting a single row.
